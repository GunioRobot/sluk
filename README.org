* What is?

Sluk is a simple feed to email program primarily meant to be used with the [[http://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]] mail indexing system.

It takes a list of rss-feeds and writes them as email messages to a directory, one file per entry.

Sluk does not send mail.

* Requirements
feedparser
  
* Usage
On invocation the program will look for the ~/.slukrc file, which should contain something like this:

: [conf]
: messages  = /home/user/mail/sluk/
: feed_list = /home/user/.sluk_feeds
: cache     = /home/user/.sluk_cache
: quiet     = true

If the option "quiet" is either missing or set to "false", sluk will babble away mercilessly.

The feed list should be a newline separated list of URL:s

Sluk uses etags and last-modified headers in order to save server bandwith.
