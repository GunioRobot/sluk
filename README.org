* What is?

Sluk is a simple feed to email program primarily meant to be used with the [[http://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]] mail indexing system.

It takes a list of rss-feeds and writes them as email messages to a directory, one file per entry.

Sluk does not send mail.

* Requirements
feedparser
  
* Usage
On invocation the program will look for the ~/.slukrc file, which should contain something like this:

: [conf]
: messages  = /home/user/mail/sluk/
: feed_list = /home/user/.sluk_feeds
: cache     = /home/user/.sluk_cache

Sluk uses etags and last-modified headers in order to save server bandwith.
